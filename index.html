        <h2>History</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Helping Hands was founded in 2022 by a group of compassionate individuals who recognized the growing issue of hunger in their community. Initially starting with small food drives and local partnerships, the charity quickly expanded due to the overwhelming support from volunteers and donors. Over the years, Helping Hands has developed comprehensive meal programs and established strong relationships with local organizations to maximize its impact. Today, the charity serves thousands of individuals and families, remaining steadfast in its mission to ensure no one goes without a meal.</p>
